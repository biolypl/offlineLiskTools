# offlineLiskTools
- Tools for offline creating and signing type 0 and type 3 Lisk transactions. 
- Tool for online sending the offline created transactions.

Just download and extract the .rar files. Since the tools are just html site with some javascript code, you should be able to run it on multiple platforms. I tested it on Windows and Linux Ubuntu.
